    Satyrid-Proceritas \n\nRun, run as soon as you see them, and do not let him leave
    your vision. This giant is built for speed, these monsters are feared hunters
    and are the most known apex predators on habitats they reside in. They're usually
    seen feeding on the corpses of recently captured prey, whether it be other monsters
    or your own friends. The best way to avoid them is to not stay out for too long,
    night is not your friend. They are always watching for you. - Sigurd"
