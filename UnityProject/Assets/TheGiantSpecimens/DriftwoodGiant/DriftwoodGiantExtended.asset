  infoNodeDescription: "Driftwood Giant\n\nSigurd's danger level: 65%\n\nScientific
    name: Satyrid-Proceritas \n\nRun, run as soon as you see them, and do not let
    him leave your vision. This giant is built for speed, these monsters are feared
    hunters and are the most known apex predators on habitats they reside in. They're
    usually seen feeding on the corpses of recently captured prey, whether it be
    other monsters or your own friends. The best way to avoid them is to not stay
    out for too long, night is not your friend. They are always watching for you.
    - Sigurd"
