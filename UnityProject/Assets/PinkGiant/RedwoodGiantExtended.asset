  infoNodeDescription: "Redwood Giant\n\nSigurd's danger level: 20%\n\nScientific
    name: Satyrid-Proceritas \n\nDon't be afraid of this giant, well maybe still
    a little, this overgrown Satyrid-proceritas is one of if not the most calmest
    of its species, mainly minding its own business. It has grown so much that it
    does not hunt humans, Instead, it rather hunts its own kind. Still, be very careful
    around them as they don't seem to care much about where they are stepping. -
    Sigurd"
